# Logistics-Analysis-Regional-Delivery-Time-Visualization
Visualizing regional delivery times in Logistics and delivery performance dashboard by region using Matplotlib and Plotly.


This project visualizes the average package delivery times across various regions of a national delivery network. As a logistics analyst, the goal was to identify performance bottlenecks and highlight efficient zones through clear, data-driven visuals.

# Objective
To create an intuitive, presentation-ready horizontal bar chart that:

Displays regional average delivery times (in hours)

Uses color-coded bars to reflect performance:

- Green for < 24 hours
- Yellow for 24â€“48 hours
- Red for > 48 hours

Labels each bar with the region name and exact delivery time

Includes a title, axis labels, and a legend for clarity


# Tools Used
Matplotlib: for a static version of the visualization

Plotly: for an interactive version of the same chart

Python (with matplotlib, plotly, and pandas)


# Dataset
A simple dictionary of regions and their average delivery times (in hours).

# Insights
Atlantic-South and North-East are high performers (delivery < 24 hrs).

South-West has the longest average delivery time, suggesting room for improvement.

The visualization helps leadership focus on underperforming regions and plan resource allocation accordingly.
